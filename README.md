### Context

1. **Creating Python virtual environment**
   - In Windows, create a new folder.
   - Open the command prompt and navigate to the folder path.
   - Create a Python virtual environment.
   - Activate the virtual environment.
   - Install required libraries.
   - Verify installed libraries.
   - Open Jupyter Notebook from the environment.

2. **Online plotting feature**
   - Create an account on Plotly.
   - Obtain username and API key from profile settings.
   - Connect to Chart Studio using credentials.
   - Edit and import data to Chart Studio for online plotting.

3. **Tools and Dataset**
   - Tools used: Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects.
   - **Plotly Express**: Module for plotting entire figures at once, with over 30 functionalities for various plot types.
   - **Plotly Graph Objects**: Provides precise data visualization through figures, data, and layouts.

4. **Dataset**
   - Iris dataset: 160 rows, 6 columns (Id, Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width, Species).
   - "Temperature_change_Data.csv" dataset: 16756 rows, 4 columns (Country Code, Country Name, year, tem_change).
   - Instance data created for specific plots for better understanding.

5. **Plots**
   ### 1. 1-Dimensional Distribution
   - **Dist plot**: Shows data distribution.
   - **Histogram**: Displays quantitative data.

   ### 2. 2-Dimensional Distribution
   - **Pie Chart**: Represents single series of data.
   - **Bar Chart**: Compares categorical data.
   - **2D Scatter plot**: Analyzes correlation between parameters.
   - **Bubble plot**: Examines correlations between three numerical variables.
   - **Strip plot**: Organized scatter plot for clear data analysis.
   - **Box and Violin plots**: Display distribution of numerical data.
   - **Error plot**: Visualizes data concentration and reliability.
   - **Heatmap**: Represents data density using color coding.

   ### 3. 3-Dimensional Distribution
   - **3D Scatter plot**: Adds depth to scatter plot with x, y, and z axes.
   - **Contour plot**: Represents 2D contour lines of numerical array Z.
   - **Polar plot**: Represents data on radial and angular axes.
   - **Radar plot**: Quantitatively represents data variables originating from the center.
